Merge Branches
We have the emergency fix ready, and so let's merge the master and emergency-fix branches.

First, we need to change to the master branch:

Example
git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Now we merge the current branch (master) with emergency-fix:

Example
git merge emergency-fix
Updating 09f4acd..dfa79db
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
Since the emergency-fix branch came directly from master, and no other changes had been made to master while we were working, Git sees this as a continuation of master. So it can "Fast-forward", just pointing both master and emergency-fix to the same commit.

As master and emergency-fix are essentially the same now, we can delete emergency-fix, as it is no longer needed:

Example
git branch -d emergency-fix
Deleted branch emergency-fix (was dfa79db).
Merge Conflict
Now we can move over to hello-world-images and keep working. Add another image file (img_hello_git.jpg) and change index.html, so it shows it:

Example
git checkout hello-world-images
Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'
