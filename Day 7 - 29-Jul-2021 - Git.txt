If you have already pushed the merge to a remote repository, you should not use git reset because it will rewrite the history and cause problems for other collaborators. Instead, you can use the git revert command to create a new commit that reverses the effects of the merge. For example, if you want to undo the last merge, you can run:

git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

$ nano .gitignore
