What is an artifact?
What is maven number?
What is groupid   ( is noting but project structure )


Steps to create a maven project

Command to create maven project
> mvn  archetype:generate



Choose a number or apply filter:  

Note: Type of the project is dependent on the above number
1740  --  For Spring project
1805  --  For sample maven project
1244 --  MVC 4 Web application
2630 --  Project for multiple platforms web, Android and iOS



Lets select the default number: 1765  -ENter default number - It will take time


Now, we need to choose the version
Lets take the default one 8



Now, Define value for group id


What is groupid
The groupId in Maven is a unique identifier for an organization or group that creates a project. It's similar to a domain name, but it's specific to Maven and serves as a way to distinguish your project from others. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

Uniqueness:

The groupId should be unique across all Maven projects. This means no two projects can have the same groupId, even if they are created by different organizations.
Structure:

It typically follows the reversed domain name of your organization or group. For example, the groupId for the Apache Maven project is org.apache.maven.
If you're an individual developer, you can use your reversed domain name like com.yourname or org.yourname.
Purpose:

The groupId helps Maven identify and locate your project. It's used when searching for dependencies, building your project, and deploying artifacts.
It also helps to organize your projects within a larger codebase. For example, if you have multiple subprojects related to the same product, you might use a common groupId with sub-identifiers for each project.
Naming conventions:

While not enforced, there are recommended conventions for naming groupIds:
Start with a reversed domain name you control.
Use lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.
Avoid special characters, underscores, or dashes.
Strive for clarity and descriptiveness.

Is used to  follow a project structure

ex:
For commercial application -- Ex:  com.<project_name>
For government application -- Ex:  gov.<project_name>
For organization application -- Ex:  org.<project_name>




Define the value for groupID: com.flipkart


What is  Artifactid: webappflipkart      ( With this name artifcat will be created )

The artifactId in Maven is the unique name of your project within the groupId. It acts like a short, memorable identifier that distinguishes your project from others, similar to how a file name identifies a specific file within a folder.

Here's a closer look at its key aspects:

Uniqueness:

The artifactId is unique within a specific groupId. This means two projects under the same groupId can't have the same artifactId, even if they're created by different developers.
Structure:

It's typically a concise and descriptive name related to your project's purpose or functionality. For example, an e-commerce project might have an artifactId like shopping-cart or order-processing.
It's often based on the project's base package name, promoting consistency and organization.
Purpose:

The artifactId helps identify and reference your project in various Maven tasks:
Downloading dependencies: Maven uses the groupId and artifactId to locate and retrieve the specific version of the project you need.
Building your project: Maven references the artifactId to identify and package the compiled classes and resources into a deployable artifact (JAR, WAR, etc.).
Deploying artifacts: Maven uses the artifactId to name the generated artifacts, making them easily recognizable and manageable.

We get  BUILD SUCCESS message




In which location project is created?
In that location, we find src folder and pom.xml file




src contains two folders.
main and test





Code created by the developer will be in main folder.
Code created by the developer for unit testing will be in test folder.




POM  --  stands for project  Object model. 
It is an xml file, which will store all the external API information.





++++++++++++++++++++++++


Open gitbash
change directory to webapppaypal
$ git init
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"

+++++++++++++++++++++
https://search.maven.org/   --  maven global  server

Developer will search for the required API  here 
Ex: 
1) search for mysql  ( select the required API )  - select version
copy the dependency tag and paste in pom.xml

2) search for google  map
copy the dependency tag and paste in pom.xml


Now, we need to download the API from Maven Global server to Maven local repository.
 Open command prompt  
 >  cd  webappflipkart
 > mvn compile

Maven local repository is created with the name  .m2

+++++++++++
Open git bash
Go to working directory
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "second commit"

++++++++++++++
Notes:  Adding 3rd party API to pom.xml file.

Observe the folder structure created in the maven project ( webappicici )
We can find the folder structure as mentioned in "groupid"

They have given sample java Project.
Copy code in App.java, lets create a new  java file, save as Sample.java  ( change class name also) 


code
---------
package com.durga;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class Sample
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        System.out.println( "Hello " );
    }
}

+++++++++++++++++++

Now, we need to compile the java files  
In command prompt
> mvn compile

Observation:
A new folder target is created in webappdurga, we can see the class files.

+++++++++++++++++
Similarly
goto src/test/java/com/durga
create  another java file with the name SampleTest.java

Add one line of code at the end  ( for our reference )
System.out.println("Testing Passed");

+++++++++++++++
Now, we need to convert the unit testing code into .class file, for that we have command 

> mvn test

++++++++++++++++
Observation:
In folder target , test-classes will be created , 
which contains .class files

+++++++++++++++++
To create Artifact

> mvn  package

Where is the location of the artifact?
