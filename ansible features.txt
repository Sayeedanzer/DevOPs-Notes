Ansible boasts a wide range of features designed to streamline and simplify 
IT automation.
Here are some of the key highlights:
Agentless: Ansible works without requiring any pre-installed agents on managed systems, 
making it lightweight and easy to deploy. It relies on secure connections 
like SSH for communication and task execution.

Simple and Human-Readable: Ansible uses YAML-based playbooks for defining 
automation tasks, making them human-readable and easy to understand even for
individuals without extensive scripting experience. This promotes collaboration 
and knowledge sharing within teams.

Flexibility and Scalability: Ansible can manage various infrastructure components,
including servers, network devices, containers, and cloud platforms. It scales
horizontally to handle large deployments and complex environments.

Module Ecosystem: Ansible offers a vast and ever-growing ecosystem of modules,
providing pre-built functionality for diverse tasks like software installation,
configuration management, and service orchestration.
